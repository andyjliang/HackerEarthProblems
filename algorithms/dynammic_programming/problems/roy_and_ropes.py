'''
Roy lit the rope on fire from the left end. This fire burns down the rope by 
1 meter/minute. 
Your task is to find how much time (in minutes) will the fire take to burn down the entire rope.

Input: 
First line contains T - number of test cases.
First line of each test case contains L - length of the rope.
Second line of each test case contains L-1
Lâˆ’1 integers separated by space denoting lengths of all the upper ropes at each meter.
Third line of each test case contains L-1
Lâˆ’1 integers separated by space denoting lengths all the lower ropes at each meter.
